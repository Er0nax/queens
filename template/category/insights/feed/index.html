<p>Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize supply chain management by increasing transparency, traceability, and security throughout the entire supply chain network. Blockchain is a decentralized and immutable digital ledger that records transactions or data in a transparent and secure manner. When applied to supply chain management, it can address challenges related to fraud, counterfeiting, data inaccuracies, and lack of visibility.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>Transparency</strong></h2>



<p>Blockchain provides a shared and transparent record of all transactions and events in the supply chain, visible to all participants. This transparency reduces disputes, enhances trust, and ensures accountability.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size">Cost and Efficiency Improvements</h2>



<p>The cost of solar panels and associated equipment has significantly decreased over the years, making solar energy more accessible and economically viable. Technological advancements have also improved the efficiency of solar panels, allowing them to convert a higher percentage of sunlight into electricity.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-4 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Traceability</strong></h2>



<p>Every step in the supply chain, from raw material sourcing to production, distribution, and final delivery, can be tracked in real time on the blockchain. This enhances traceability and enables quick identification of the source of any issues.</p>
