<p>Supply chain disruptions refer to unexpected events or factors that disrupt the normal flow of goods, services, or information within a supply chain network. These disruptions can have significant negative impacts on businesses, including delays, increased costs, reduced customer satisfaction, and even financial losses. Supply chain resilience, on the other hand, refers to a supply chain&#8217;s ability to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from disruptions, ensuring minimal disruption to operations and the ability to bounce back quickly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>Natural Disasters</strong></h2>



<p>Events like earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and wildfires can disrupt transportation routes, damage infrastructure, and disrupt production facilities.</p>
